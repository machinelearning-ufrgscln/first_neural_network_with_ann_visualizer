# first_neural_network_with_ann_visualizer

We developed a simple neural network in Python using the libraries Theano, Tensorflow and Keras.

We follow the tutorial available here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/

This repository also contains the dataset used to try the neural network.

We tried to generate the network view using the ANN Visualizer Library, following the tutorial available here:
https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-artificial-neural-networks-anns-with-just-one-line-of-code-b4233607209e

However, we were only able to generate the input layer display.

The code generated a .gv file, available in this repository. 

To view it, you need to download the Graphviz software, available for download here: https://www.graphviz.org/
